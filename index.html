    <h1 class="text-center">Brief</h1>
    <p>Imagine that our team wants to find out why a subset of our users are not engaging with a particular feature in the app.</p>

    <p>We are planning to do an email survey, which has a combination of yes/no questions, some ‘agree-disagree’ questions on a scale and some ‘open-ended’ paragraph questions.</p>

    <p>What would you recommend to the team to make sure the survey we are planning gets valid and actionable results?</p>
    <p>How would you communicate your feedback to the team?</p>
    <p>And how would you communicate the results of that survey to the wider business?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container mt-5">
    <h1 class="text-center">Baby Steps</h1>
    <p>Before rushing into putting together the survey, we've got to ask ourselves a few questions first.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What feature do we want to ask about?</li>
      <li>Who do we want to ask?</li>
      <li>How can we get the most accurate information possible?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Given that we're being asked to enquire a specific feature, we can tick that off first.</p>
    <p>Next - notice that not all users are avoiding this feature, just a subset.</p>
    <p>We need to use whatever data is available to pinpoint <strong>commonalities</strong> of this "subset". Does their behaviour pertain to what types of items they buy? How long their sessions on the app are? Their location/age/ethnicity/gender?</p>

    <p>If we can identify the generic characteristics of this subset, we can sketch out user personas as a useful guide for creating questions further in the process.</p>

    <img class="mx-auto img-fluid" src="ingrid.png" alt="">

    <p>Once we have an idea of who we want to ask and what their usual behaviours are, we can start talking about creating and optimising the survey.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Focus the questions on the smallest area possible (in our case, one feature).</li>
      <li>Offer an incentive for accurate survey completion.</li>
      <li>Minimise effort required from the user.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>From first-hand experience, most people will see surveys as an imposition. Get them in and out as quickly and efficiently as possible, and give them an incentive to be as honest and constructive as possible.</p>
